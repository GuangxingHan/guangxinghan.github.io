# Welcome to Guangxing Han(韩光星)'s Homepage

## Biography

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at [DVMM Lab](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/newHome.htm), Columbia University, working with Prof. Shih-Fu Chang. 

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Chongrong Li. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2014.

My current research topics are computer vision and deep learning, and I am particularly interested in object detection, few shot learning, meta-learning, self-supervised learning, transformer and prompting.
