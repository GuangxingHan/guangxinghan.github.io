## Biography

I am currently a **final year Ph.D. candidate** in Department of Computer Science and Technology in Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Chongrong Li. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2014.

My current research topics include object detection in images and videos, person re-identification and GANs.
