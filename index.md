## Biography

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at [DVMM Lab](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/newHome.htm), Columbia University, working with Prof. Shih-Fu Chang. 

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Chongrong Li. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2014.

My current research topics include object detection, few shot learning, transformer models and visual-linguistic applications.
